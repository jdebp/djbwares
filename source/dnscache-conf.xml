<para>
dnscache-conf sets up a DNS cache service.

This is a reference page. For tutorial information, see the instructions for workstations, home computers, external caches, or upgrading from BIND.

Interface
     dnscache-conf acct logacct D ip
dnscache-conf creates a service directory D that runs dnscache. The name D must start with a slash and must not contain any special characters. Normally D is /etc/dnscache.

You can run the service under svscan by creating a symbolic link in the svscan directory:

     ln -s D /service
The service will start within five seconds, and will be restarted upon reboot. You can use svc to control the service.
dnscache-conf arranges for dnscache to chroot to D/root and to run under the uid and gid of acct. The name acct must not contain any special characters.

dnscache-conf arranges for dnscache to listen for UDP packets and TCP connections on port 53 of ip. ip is optional; if it is not supplied, dnscache-conf arranges for dnscache to listen on 127.0.0.1. dnscache-conf creates D/root/ip/127.0.0.1 so that dnscache will accept queries from 127.0.0.1.

dnscache-conf puts 128 bytes of not-particularly-secret data into D/seed and arranges for dnscache to pass D/seed to dns_random_init. If your system has a good source of random data, you can replace D/seed with 128 bytes of data from that source.

dnscache-conf creates an automatically rotated log directory in D/log/main. The logs are owned by logacct. The corresponding multilog processes run under the uid and gid of logacct. The name logacct must not contain any special characters.
